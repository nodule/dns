    "description": "All methods in the dns module use C-Ares except for dns.lookup which uses getaddrinfo(3) in a thread pool. C-Ares is much faster than getaddrinfo but the system resolver is more constant with how other programs operate. When a user does net.connect(80, 'google.com') or http.get({ host: 'google.com' }) the dns.lookup method is used. Users who need to do a large number of lookups quickly should use the methods that go through C-Ares."
